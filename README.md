# AWS | Cloud-Cost-Optimization---Identifying-Stale-Resources


This project demonstrates an automated AWS cost optimization solution that identifies and deletes stale Amazon EBS snapshots which are no longer associated with any active EC2 instances.

Unused EBS snapshots accumulate over time and increase storage costs. This solution uses AWS Lambda to automatically detect and remove such stale resources.
